<p>We found a huge lake and stopped to rest including a fresh sip of water. My friends and I start scouting around, but we got lost exploring. Zotom was the eldest of the group, he went in the direction of the bear's cave. The twins, 
Dohoson and Dohosun were the youngest of the group, were somehow still together. </p>

          <p>Anyway, I went to this nearby stream to find some buffalo sipping water. To my suprise a big brown buffalo drank his water steadily. </p>
